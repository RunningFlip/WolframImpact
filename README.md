RTS (Real-Time Strategy) Prototype with Custom Entity-Component-System (ECS)

This prototype features a custom ECS designed to optimize system execution through better delegation, 
allowing components of the same type to be processed together. Additionally, it bundles system operations into a single update call in Unity, improving performance and efficiency.
